  In recent years, NASA's Kepler space telescope and other observatories have
  discovered more than 1,800 extra-solar planets, with thousands of additional
  "candidate" planets awaiting confirmation. Current technology is nowhere near
  able to allow quick intergalactic travel, but if you somehow wound up on an
  Earth-size alien world, what would you experience?
